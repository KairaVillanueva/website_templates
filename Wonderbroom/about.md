<p style="margin-right:10em;" align="justify">Currently studying computer science in the hopes of understanding the common ground between humans and machines, as well as the impact of AI on ecological modelling and social issues. I am in a perpetual process of dissecting games and how it could be better applied in the natural world. I also write about games, develop, and design them.</p>
